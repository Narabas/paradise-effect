      <p>Alignments are a cooperative ability separate from, but still influenced by, the powers of your Soul Class.
        Each Soul Class has two different alignments that they can do, each with a different Soul Class and a different
        power, or outcome. What determines which Soul Class can align with which, is their placement on the Soul Wheel.
        The two Soul Classes that frame your own are the ones that you can align with. The table below shows who can
        align with whom:</p>
      <img src="../../assets/images/ALIGNMENTS.png" width="90%"
        style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
      <p>The Alignment abilities are not the same as ones in other Campaigns, so for the moment what each of these
        alignments can do are unknown. However, they will be revealed here as they are discovered in the Campaign.</p>
      <p>Characters also cannot purposefully use alignment abilities until they are <b>Level 5</b>, which means this is
        more of
        a later-game mechanic!</p>
