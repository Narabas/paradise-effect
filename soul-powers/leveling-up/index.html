      <h1>Leveling Up</h1>
      Leveling up is how your character becomes stronger and more in control of their Soul Class and its abilities.
      Check out the table below to see what leveling up provides for each Class!
      <p>As a note, the powers for levels 1 through 5 are not absolute, and can be bent to include a variety of
        expressions of these powers. These are simply examples of the max power that the character possesses at this
        level.</p>
      <p>Levels 1 through 5 will be revealed once characters have awakened their Soul Class!</p><br>

    <div class="content-info wider">
      <p>All characters will start at Level 0, but those with a higher stat in their corresponding Soul Class stat will
        have some measure of higher level powers available to them from the start. More information on this can be found
        on the <a href="../../soul-powers/drawbacks/">Drawbacks</a> page.</p>
      <p>Over the course of the campaign, your character will level up naturally if a post criteria is met during each
        Chapter. That is, if you post 10 or more posts during a single Chapter, then you can consider your character
        leveled up once the Chapter is complete and the interim has begun. There will be a designated channel for
        logging these level ups, which will be recommended, but not required!</p>

      <p>For people who aren't able to meet this criteria during the coinciding Chapters, or people who want to level up
        faster, you'll be able to level up during any following interim or Chapter by submitting literature or art that
        meets these criteria as outlined below:</p>
      <br>
      <p class="lu">
        <b>Lvl 0 to Lvl 1:</b> "Prompt"<br>
        <i>Unlocked at the start of Interim 1 (post-Chapter 1)</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>[Art] At least a Headshot sketch, no background.</li>
        <li>[Literature] At least 500 words.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="lu">
        <b>Lvl 1 to Lvl 2:</b> "Prompt"<br>
        <i>Unlocked at the start of Interim 1 (post-Chapter 1)</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>[Art] At least a Flat Color headshot, no background.</li>
        <li>[Literature] At least 700 words.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="lu">
        <b>Lvl 2 to Lvl 3:</b> "Prompt"<br>
        <i>Unlocked at the start of Interim 2 (post-Chapter 2)</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>[Art] At least a Shaded headshot, minimal background.</li>
        <li>[Literature] At least 900 words.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="lu">
        <b>Lvl 3 to Lvl 4:</b> "Prompt"<br>
        <i>Unlocked at the start of Interim 2 (post-Chapter 2)</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>[Art] At least a Flat Color fullbody, minimal background.</li>
        <li>[Literature] At least 1200 words.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="lu">
        <b>Lvl 4 to Lvl 5:</b> "Prompt"<br>
        <i>Unlocked at the start of Interim 3 (post-Chapter 3)</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>[Art] At least a Shaded fullbody with a full background.</li>
        <li>[Literature] At least 1500 words.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <p>Prompts will be released as we reach those points in the Campaign.</p>
      <p>Additionally, you can delay the in-character effects of a level up at your discretion. Just because the power
        is available to them, doesn't mean they have to use it right away!</p>
      <p>Lastly, regardless of how it is you level up, every time you level up you'll be granted +1 stat point to be
        placed in any stat that you want, for a total of 5 extra stat points when leveled up completely. This will far
        from be the only way you'll gain stats over the course of the campaign, but it is the most predictable and
        reliable way.</p>
