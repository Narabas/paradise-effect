      <h1>Power Expressions</h1>

      <p>One of the few mechanics unique to The Paradise Effect are what's called Power Expressions, or Expressions of
        Power, whichever way you want to say it. These mechanics are very simple and very personalized to each
        character, but make sure to read this entire page before considering what you may want for your character going
        forward!</p>
      <p>So, what <i>are</i> Power Expressions?</p>
      <p>Simply put they're a way for your character to have a more personalized experience within their own Soul Class.
        Every character will have <b>one</b> Power Expression, and once chosen, they <b>cannot</b> be changed.</p>
      <p>Power Expressions fall into two categories:</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      <h5>Internal</h5>
      Internal Power Expressions tend to be a single extra ability that your character has that is not already
      covered within their powers, or an extra boost to powers that are already there. Examples of Internal Power
      Expressions will be added once more information has come out pertaining to each Class's abilities.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      <h5>External</h5>
      External Power Expressions are usually aesthetic, but can also be functional. </p>
      <p>Think of it like wings on a Green Soul or a Black Soul so pitch dark they look like they're sporting vantablack
        fur, a Blue Soul with fins, a Purple Soul with permanent frost markings, or a Red Soul with dragon-like spines
        on their back. As long as it pertains to their powers it's possible!</p>
      <br>
      <hr><br>
      <p>Players will not be able to select a Power Expression until your character is officially Level 3 (after having
        leveled up three times), so there's plenty of time for you to think it over before deciding. However, once
        you're sure you know what you want, you can either open a ticket or DM your GM to let them know! Your choice
        will be logged in a Google Sheets and again, <b>cannot</b> be changed once chosen.</p>
