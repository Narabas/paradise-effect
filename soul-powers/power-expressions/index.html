      <h1>Power Expressions</h1>

      <p>One of the few mechanics unique to The Paradise Effect are what's called Power Expressions, or Expressions of
        Power, whichever way you want to say it. These mechanics are very simple and very personalized to each
        character, but make sure to read this entire page before considering what you may want for your character going
        forward!</p>
      <p>So, what <i>are</i> Power Expressions?</p>
      <p>Simply put they're a way for your character to have a more personalized experience within their own Soul Class.
        Every character will have <b>one</b> Power Expression, and once chosen, they <b>cannot</b> be changed.</p>
      <p>Power Expressions fall into two categories:</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      <h5>Internal</h5>
      Internal Power Expressions tend to be a single extra ability that your character has that is not already
      covered within their powers, or an extra boost to powers that are already there. These fall into one of three
      different categories.</p>
      <div class="side-effect" style="display:block;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enhancing power that already
          exists within your Soul Class.</span>
        <p>A permanent increase to one of your overall powers (ex. fire or earth for Red Souls, but not both fire and
          earth), otherwise known as always using power that's one level above your own without drawbacks. (Limits will
          be made for level 5 users when we get there). Your powers are considered more powerful than average, but
          otherwise do not extend outside the abilities and drawbacks listed on your Soul Power’s page.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="side-effect" style="display:block;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">A new, Soul Class-specific power
          not otherwise covered by your current powers, but which still relates to the powers of your class and can
          function as a specialization.</span> These can include bypassing Soul Power limitations, but must be specific
        in their
        usage.
        <br><br>
        For Example:
        <ul>
          <li><span
              style="background:var(--rime);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">PURPLE</span>
            The ability to teleport to a location unseen/unknown.
            <ul>
              <li>Lumi’s power expression was the ability to create ice that never melts unless by
                unnatural means.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><span
              style="background:var(--scorch);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">RED</span>
            The ability to levitate earth off the ground.<br><br></li>
          <li><span
              style="background:var(--spark);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">YELLOW</span>
            The ability to fully transform into a single different animal.<br><br></li>
          <li><span
              style="background:var(--spring);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">GREEN</span>
            The ability to breathe in low oxygen environments.
            <ul>
              <li>Callisto's power expression is the ability to make new plants of his own design.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><span
              style="background:var(--torrent);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">BLUE</span>
            The ability to hear underwater as though you were above water.
            <ul>
              <li>Chasm’s power expression is the ability to create illusions that accurately mimic a cat's younger
                self.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><span
              style="background:var(--wither);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">BLACK</span>
            The ability to make a cat, creature, or object invisible that's not yourself.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="side-effect" style="display:block;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">An ability that exists at the
          corner of your Soul Class and a different one, though not necessarily one that aligns with your class.</span>
        This is a specialization that combines your Soul Class’s ability with another as an inherent aspect of your
        character’s power rather than anything related to a formal Alignment.
        <br><br>
        For Example:
        <ul>
          <li><span
              style="background:var(--rime);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">PURPLE</span>
            The ability to make ice figures that move independently and can be controlled by the user.
            (Black)<br><br></li>
          <li><span
              style="background:var(--scorch);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">RED</span>
            The ability to make fire that heals instead of hurts. (Green)<br><br></li>
          <li><span
              style="background:var(--spark);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">YELLOW</span>
            The ability to bend light in order to become invisible. (Black)<br><br></li>
          <li><span
              style="background:var(--spring);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">GREEN</span>
            The ability to create an eye of the hurricane effect. (Blue)<br><br></li>
          <li><span
              style="background:var(--torrent);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">BLUE</span>
            The ability to use your illusions to alter your appearance to others. (Yellow)
            <ul>
              <li>Rye’wynn's power expression is the ability to teleport through standing bodies of water. (Purple)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><span
              style="background:var(--wither);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">BLACK</span>
            The ability to spontaneously combust matter as a form of decay. (Red)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>Keep in mind that a lot of these powers will be limited based on your level as well! They will grow with you,
        but unlike normal powers you won't have the opportunity to use higher level versions of them at lower levels.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      <h5>External</h5>
      External Power Expressions are usually aesthetic, but can also be functional. These can be based on real or
      fantastical creaturers or phenomenon.</p>
      <div class="side-effect" style="display: block;">
        <p>Wings are something that can be used for every Soul Class, but need to be thematically appropriate to the
          Class. Kohaku's power expression is an example of this.</p>

        For Example:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span
              style="background:var(--rime);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">PURPLE</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Perpetual ice body parts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Starry "glitter" or frost in/on fur, skin, etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Anything related to cold weather animals (deer, rabbits/hares, wolves, etc.).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span
              style="background:var(--scorch);padding:0 5px;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;font-weight: 900;">RED</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Perpetually flaming/earthen body parts.
              </li>

                Anything related to animals in general.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>

      <p>Players will not be able to select a Power Expression until we enter into Chapter 3 <b>and</b> your character
        is officially Level 3 (after having
        leveled up three times), so there's plenty of time for you to think it over before deciding. However, once
        you're sure you know what you want, you can either open a ticket or DM your GM to let them know! Your choice
        will be logged in a Google Sheets and again, <b>cannot</b> be changed once chosen.</p>
