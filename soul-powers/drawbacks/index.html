            <h1>Drawbacks</h1>
            <p>Ah yes, not everything can be good now, can it?</p>
            <p>In addition to all of these fun new powers and capabilities, there will be drawbacks as well. Drawbacks,
                by definition, will be mechanics that will actively hinder and hold back characters while they attempt
                to use their powers and progress through the campaign. For now there are two distinct types of
                Drawbacks, and those areâ€“</p>
            <br>
            <h5>Side Effects</h5>
            First introduced in Paradise Rising, side effects are intrusive, personal issues that crop up as a result
            of a character having a certain Soul Class. As they level up and grow stronger, these Side Effects are
            known to grow more apparent, more intrusive, and more frequent, but once characters Soulroot at or near
            the end of the campaign, these Side Effects will dissipate entirely.
            <p>How much or how little a character leans into these Side Effects is determined by their player, but the
                GM may also utilize them as prompts in Checkpoints as an added challenge.</p>

            <div class="side-effect">
                <div class="side-effect-label" style="background:#A59EA9;">
                    <h5><br>
                        PURPLE
                    </h5>
                </div>
                Due to the distant and aloof nature of Purple Souls, they can be prone to closing themselves off and
                acting without regard for others, especially at higher levels. They're known to choose self-survival
                over empathy or compassion.
            </div>

            <div class="side-effect">
                <div class="side-effect-label" style="background:#A8908A;">
                    <h5><br>
                        RED
                    </h5>
                </div>
                Due to the temperamental and stubborn nature of Red Souls, they can be prone to emotional outbursts and
                extreme fits of rage, especially at higher levels. They're known to overreact and lash out in the heat
                of the moment.
            </div>

            <div class="side-effect">
                <div class="side-effect-label" style="background:#c7bd93;">
                    <h5><br>
                        YELLOW
                    </h5>
                </div>
                Due to the overbearing and meddling nature of Yellow Souls, they can be prone to controlling those
                around
                them and rejecting any authority that is not their own, especially at higher levels. They're known to
                use whatever means necessary to get their way.
            </div>

            <div class="side-effect">
                <div class="side-effect-label" style="background:#9EAB8F;">
                    <h5><br>
                        GREEN
                    </h5>
                </div>
                Due to the self-sacrificial and meek nature of Green Souls, they can be prone to losing themselves in
                their pursuit of saving others, especially at higher levels. They're known to ignore their own
                well-being to extreme degrees.
            </div>

            <div class="side-effect">
                <div class="side-effect-label" style="background:#929AA4;">
                    <h5><br>
                        BLUE
                    </h5>
                </div>
                Due to the capricious and cautious nature of Blue Souls, they can be prone to deep levels of mistrust
                and manipulation of others, especially at higher levels. They're known to change tactics on a dime,
                garnering them a reputation of being two-faced.
            </div>

            <div class="side-effect">
                <div class="side-effect-label" style="background:#8D8F88;">
                    <h5><br>
                        BLACK
                    </h5>
                </div>
                Due to the short-sighted and absolutist nature of Black Souls, they can be prone to casting extreme
                judgment on others without exception, especially at higher levels. They're known to shun those around
                them, never finding someone who fits their ideals completely.
            </div>

            <br><br>
            <h5>Power Overuse</h5>
            <p>Just like characters can't run faster than they've trained to run, powers cannot be used too far removed
                from where a character's actual capabilities lie.</p>
            <p>At max, a character can only use powers <b>3 levels higher</b> than their own. This means, at the start
                of the Campaign, all characters can only use <b>up to</b> Level 3 powers, if their corresponding Soul
                Class stat allows for it. </p>
            <p>As it was briefly touched upon on the Leveling Up page, all characters will start the Campaign at Level 0
                and will have to grow up to Level 5 throughout the Campaign either through leveling up during a Chapter
                via the 10 posts, submitting level up prompts during Interims, or some mix. That said, there is
                something to be said for characters who share a Soul Class, but who have different starting stats within
                that Soul Class. In general, those who have a higher corresponding Soul Class stat will have access to
                higher level powers right off the bat. This is true for this Campaign as well, but there will be risks
                involved.</p>
            <p>In addition to these personal Drawbacks, there's also an enhanced probability for power usage to go wonky
                when attempting to use more power than you have, so use your powers wisely!</p>
            <p>Here's a chart of the ramifications of using higher leveled powers:</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Your character feels light-headed, sore, and weak in the paws. </p>
                    <p>For two posts <b>after</b> your post, your character will not be able to attack, flee, or dodge
                        with any success. These posts don't have to be your own, they can be posts from your teammates
                        as well.</p>
                    <p>You can only use powers 1 Level Higher than your own 3 times per Chapter, your Soul Class stat
                        permitting.</p>
                    <p>Duration-based attacks or abilities are 1/2 of their duration time, rounded up to the nearest
                        number divisible by 5!</p>

                    <p>For four posts <b>after</b> your post, your character will not be able to attack, flee, or dodge
                        with any success. These posts don't have to be your own, they can be posts from your teammates

            <p><b>For Example</b></p>
            <p>Root and Gorse are both Level 0 Red Souls, and will both have to level up from Level 0 throughout the
                campaign. However, while Root's Strength Stat is 3, Gorse's Strength stat is 10. This means that, at max
                power, Root would have access to Level 1 Powers, and Gorse would have access to up to Level 3 powers
                since he's currently level 0.</p>
            <p>That said, once Gorse makes it to Level 2, then that means due to his 10 in his Strength stat, he would
                have access to Level 5 powers should he choose to use them.</p>
