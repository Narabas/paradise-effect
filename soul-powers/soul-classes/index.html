    <h1>Soul Classes</h1>
    Every Soul has a color, and each color designates abilities that that soul can utilize in their everyday lives, for
    a variety of reasons, as well as a general stereotype of those who share that Soul Class with one another. How true
    the stereotype is, is up to individual interpretation.
    <p>Guessing your character's Soul Class will come during Chapter 01. You will be prompted when the time comes, so
      don't worry about missing out!</p>

        </div>
        <p>Purple Souls are beings of ice and space.
          They rely on their own mental acuity for their powers, which means the more intelligence one has, the stronger
          they are when they awaken their soul. Although there are many facets to being a Purple Soul, by and large
          they're considered to be clever and observant cats, with a complex and aloof side most try to avoid. They have
          a tendency to act on their own, without taking into account the thoughts and feelings of others.</p>

        <p>Red Souls are beings of fire and earth. They rely on their own physicality for their
          powers, which means the more strength one has, the stronger they are when they awaken their soul. Although
          there are many facets to being a Red Soul, by and large they're considered to be passionate and friendly cats,
          with an aggressive and hot-headed side most try to avoid. They have a tendency to stand their ground with an
          unrelenting, stubborn resolve.</p>

        <p>Yellow Souls are beings of plasma and transformation. They rely on their own
          vitality for their powers, which means the more constitution one has, the stronger they are when they awaken
          their soul. Although there are many facets to being a Yellow Soul, by and large
          they're considered to be hard-working and adaptable cats, with an overbearing and unpredictable side most try
          to avoid. They have a tendency to advise and guide others, sometimes to an almost controlling degree.</p>

        <p>Green Souls are beings of wind and growth. They rely on their own worldly
          understanding for their powers, which means the more wisdom one has, the stronger they are when they awaken
          their soul. Although there are many facets to being a Green Soul, by and large they're considered to be
          selfless and playful cats, with a meek and non-committal side most try to avoid. They have a tendency to
          become martyrs in times of strife.</p>

          </h5>
        </div>
        <p>Blue Souls are beings of water and illusion. They rely on their own social tact for
          their powers, which means the more charisma one has, the stronger they are when they awaken their soul.
          Although there are many facets to being a Blue Soul, by and large they're considered to be calm and diplomatic
          cats, with a whimsical and cautious side most try to avoid. They have a tendency to be cool under pressure,
          which makes them naturally inclined to leadership positions.</p>

        <p>Black Souls are beings of shadows and decay. They rely on their own finesse for
          their powers, which means the more dexterity one has, the stronger they are when they awaken their soul.
          Although there are many facets to being a Black Soul, by and large they're considered to be independent and
          thoughtful cats, with a short-sighted and scheming side most try to avoid. They have a tendency to see matters
          in absolute, black and white terms.</p>
