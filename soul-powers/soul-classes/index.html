      <h1>Soul Classes</h1>
Every Soul has a color, and each color designates abilities that that soul can utilize in their everyday lives, for a variety of reasons, as well as a general stereotype of those who share that Soul Class with one another. How true the stereotype is, is up to individual interpretation.
<p>There are six Soul Colors in total, but for the moment, one of them remains unknown. This mystery will be solved at the very start of the campaign, before Soul Color guesses are even attempted. Therefore, don't worry about potentially missing your guess because you aren't aware of this sixth color. You'll know it in plenty of time to guess!</p>
<p>The secondary abilities of the known Soul Classes will be unknown at the start as well. However, these will be revealed as soon as cats know their Soul Class.</p>
