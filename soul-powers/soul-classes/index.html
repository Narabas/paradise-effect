    <h1>Soul Classes</h1>
    Every Soul has a color, and each color designates abilities that that soul can utilize in their everyday lives, for
    a variety of reasons, as well as a general stereotype of those who share that Soul Class with one another. How true
    the stereotype is, is up to individual interpretation.
    <p>There are six Soul Colors in total, but for the moment, one of them remains unknown. Before a Soul Class is
      officially chosen for any character, every player will have the opportunity to select <b>one</b> Least Preferred
      Soul
      Class for their character as well as any Soul Classes that they've played before in other Soul Class Campaigns
      (The Paradise Trials, Paradise Rising, and Chasing Paradise) that they wouldn't want to play again, in a Google
      Form survey that will go out after the Prologue is completed. You <b>can</b> choose a Least Preferred that is
      different
      than those you've played before/wouldn't play again.</p>
    <p>The mystery Soul Class will be solved at the very start of the campaign, before the survey even goes out, and the
      same is true for the reveal of the secondary abilities of each Soul Class. Therefore, you'll have all the
      information needed in order to make an educated statement about the one you don't want.</p>
    <p>Guessing your character's Soul Class will come during Chapter 01. You will be prompted when the time comes, so
      don't worry about missing out!</p>

          they are when they awaken their soul. Although there are many facets to being a Purple Soul, by and large
          they're considered to be clever and observant cats, with a complex and aloof side most try to avoid. They have
          a tendency to act on their own, without taking into account the thoughts and feelings of others.</p>
