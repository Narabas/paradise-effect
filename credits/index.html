<p>Hey! Name's Fox or Foxi, whichever you fancy, and I go by they/them pronouns. I play Holly that Willow Branches Touch in Paradise Rising, and have been a frequent flyer in the Warrior Cats roleplay community for several, several years. The last roleplay I staffed for was created by myself, my boyfriend, Narl, and our two close friends, Okibi and Koiffee. It was a Warrior Cats roleplay we called Return to the Wild, and it was an incredibly fun, if taxing, endeavor.</p>
<p>When the decision was made to close it, it was mutual between the four of us. It was a lot more work than we were prepared and able to put in indefinitely. That's why, when I took some time to think of what I wanted to do after it was closed, putting together a set end campaign felt more manageable overall, and was in line with what I enjoyed most– DMing.</p>
<p>I was originally going to do traditional D&D, but after another Soul Class campaign came out, I reached out to Stan and asked if I'd be able to run one as well. To my surprise, she said yes!</p>
<p>I was ecstatic!</p>
<p>Despite knowing how much effort and time such a campaign would take, especially at the high number of players as I was already planning to try for, I felt confident that with multi-month interims thrown into the mix, that I would be able to handle it. Whether or not that's true remains to be seen, but I am incredibly excited to give it a try, to learn and adjust as I grow, and to attempt to create a fun campaign for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Please feel free to DM me with questions, concerns, or anything at all! I'm not the most chatty person you'll ever meet, but I promise I'm friendly and open to conversation, plotting and planning, and everything in between and elsewise.</p>
<p>My socials are below, but discord is always the best place to reach me.</p>
