        <h1>How to Apply</h1>
        So you've read all the information there is to read, you've created your character, and you're ready to submit them. Awesome! Fill out the Google Form linked below when you're ready, and then hit submit. Then you'll be all set to go!
        <p>The form is editable, and submissions will not be peeped until applications close on May 22nd, so feel free to change and add stuff over time after you have submitted it!</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;opacity:0.2;">GOOGLE FORM</h2>
        <p><div style="background:#d2d4c8;color:#222;padding:10px;text-align:center;"><b>The application period is now over! Please check back at the end of the week to see the results. Thank you so much to everyone who applied!</b></div></p>
        <p>If you want your application reviewed for errors, you can also post it in the <span style="background:#222;">#app-pre-reviews</span> channel under the <b>Help</b> category, or open a ticket in our Discord planning server. The GM will then review it as soon as they can, and mention anything that's missing/needs revision!</p>
        <p>Additionally, feel free to post your completed application in the channel <span style="background:#222;">#completed-apps</span> listed under the <b>Main Area</b> category! It's not required, but it does offer a place for you to put your character so others can read about them, if that's something that you're interested in. It won't affect your acceptance whether or not you post there.</p>
        <p>Here's a link to the Discord if you haven't already joined: <a href="https://discord.gg/7Q2JjHTHBP" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/7Q2JjHTHBP</a></p>
