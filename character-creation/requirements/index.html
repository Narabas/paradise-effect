        <h1>Requirements</h1>
        In order to apply for this campaign, you'll need to complete both parts of the application and post them somewhere that you can externally link them, such as DeviantArt, Tumblr, Dropbox, Toyhouse, Google Docs, etc. If you need help finding somewhere you can post them, feel free to reach out to your GM and they'll get you set up!
        <p>Keep in mind that this isn't a first come, first serve Campaign. In the event that the number of applications surpasses the number of open slots for the Campaign, participants will then be chosen by the GM based on which characters they feel will best fit the Campaign itself.</p>
        <p>Good luck!</p>
        <div style="text-align:center;">

          <br>
          <p>Character art on applications can be your own, commissioned, or colored lineart as long as proper credit is given.</p>

        <p><b>Soul Class:</b> <span style="user-select:none;opacity:0.5;">At the start of the campaign, this should be filled out as Unknown or N/A. Please don't tell me, the GM, which Soul Class you prefer for your character, or which one that you believe they will be! I'd rather not be influenced when it comes to making Soul Class decisions if I can help it.</span></p>
        <p><b>Soul Level:</b> <span style="user-select:none;opacity:0.5;">At the start of the campaign, this should be filled out as 0.</span></p>
        <p><b>Soul Shade:</b> <span style="user-select:none;opacity:0.5;">This shouldn't be filled out until the very end of the campaign, once you've found your Soul Partner(s), but it's nice to have a space for it nonetheless.</span></p>
        <p><b>Soul Partner(s):</b> <span style="user-select:none;opacity:0.5;">At the start of the campaign, this should be filled out as Unknown or N/A.</span></p>

        <p><b>Appearance:</b> <span style="user-select:none;opacity:0.5;">No length requirement, but please try to include a little about their build, pelt, colors, eyes, and scars. You can break this up into multiple sections if you prefer.</span></p>

        <p><b>History:</b> <span style="user-select:none;opacity:0.5;">Your character's history, which should end with them falling asleep after finding the star fragment, and hearing that voice in their dreams. Please summarize and/or bullet point the history in another section if you personally feel like it's too long as is.</span></p>
        <p><b>Exclusions:</b> <span style="user-select:none;opacity:0.5;">Any characters or events in your character's backstory that you want to have excluded from GM use throughout the Campaign. This will not affect your admission into the Campaign, and you can have as many or as little as you want.</span></p>
        <p><b>Writing Sample:</b> <span style="user-select:none;opacity:0.5;">Just an example of your writing. It doesn't have to be the character you're applying with, and it doesn't have to be long.</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>Feel free to elaborate as much as you want on any section, and to add more sections, or move sections around with formatting. Have fun with it! I can't wait to see the kinds of characters you guys apply with.</p>
