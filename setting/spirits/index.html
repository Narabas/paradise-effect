      <h1>Spirits</h1>
      <hr><br>
      In the world of The Paradise Effect, not a lot is known about spirits.
      <p>Most cats don't even notice that they exist, and some may go their entire lives without ever witnessing one.
        However, the effects of these spirits are something that everyone experiences, whether or not they know the root
        cause.</p>
      <p>They are beings with no beginning and no end, one day simply appearing from thin air and traipsing the earth
        like it's their own. To the less attuned types, they remain invisible, unable to be sensed through any means. To
        those with heightened awareness they can look like anything from warbling, humming shadows to phantom
        footprints; everyday animals a little to the left, or a strange burning sensation left across the skin. Their
        appearance varies wildly, and beyond all examples given, but their existence shares a common thread.</p>
      <p>Spirits embody an emotion, a feeling, an abstract concept that they chase to the benefit or detriment of those
        around them. Some are benevolent beings inciting play or joy, or even protection, while others linger with their
        metaphorical teeth bared, creating discord filled with malevolent intent and aggression abound.</p>
      <p>There are scattered and disjointed tales about powerful cats who could control them, tempering the worst of
        their natures. But those are just myths...</p>
      <p>Right?</p>
