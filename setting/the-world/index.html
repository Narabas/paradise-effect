      <h1>The World</h1>
      <hr><br>
      The world is in its death throes, and has been for as long as any cat can remember
      <p>The land is largely uninhabitable, with most greenery withered and gone and most water sources polluted with an
        oily, poisonous residue. The animals who relied on the earth to feed them now exist in sparse pockets scattered
        at all corners, and the animals who prey upon them have gone with them. Most food is now found in discarded
        waste bins, old rundown ruins, and the hands of humans, whose motivations are capricious and strange.</p>
      <p>The ground itself is awash in dull brown dust and smoky ash. What were once large forests filled with life are
        now nothing more than old stone, dry grass, and dead, petrified trees. The skies are constantly covered in thick
        clouds and smog, leaving behind a desaturated, deathly hue for all who live beneath it. The only stark color for
        miles upon miles around are the bright, neon lights of domed human cities, which bring with them their own
        unique dangers, odd sounds and smells, and more company than many are comfortable with.</p>
      <p>The seasons have shifted from four to two. An intense and unbearably hot summer, and a desolate, bitterly cold
        winter. Natural disasters are far more common these days than in years past, including wildfires, tornados,
        earthquakes, and blizzards.</p>
      <p>Survival is paramount and nearly impossible. You must be adaptable and ready to face all challenges in order to
        live another day.</p>
      <p>Something that cats seem incredibly fit forâ€¦</p>
