      <h1>Keepers</h1>
      <hr><br>
      <p>Keepers are beings that exist somewhere between myth and reality. Cats hear about them in tales, rumors, and
        disjointed accounts colored with the bias of those who speak them. </p>
      <p>It's hard to tell where fiction ends and real life begins, but a common thread that exists within all of these
        stories is that Keepers were once normal cats themselves. They sought to attain great power, and were granted it
        from the earth itself. In turn, they were charged with maintaining the balance of the world, and did so for
        centuries. </p>
      <p>What happened and where they've gone, or if they've gone, well–</p>
      <p>No one really knows.</p>
      <p>And that's only for those who believe in them.</p>
      <p>Many cats are even convinced that they're nothing more than simple legends, or a hope for desperate cats and
        colonies to cling to amidst all the dangers of the world. All things considered, this seems just as likely as
        every other tale passed around.</p>
      <p>And is less likely to get you killed.</p>
