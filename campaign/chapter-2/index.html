            Rye'wynn and the other Keepers appear to sort you with the utmost care, but you can't help but feel
            unsettled by what they've dealt you. Most, or possibly <i>all</i>, of the pawful of cats who now stand
            around
            you are as unfamiliar to you as these new Keepers.
            <p>You open your mouth to protest– Shouldn't a team be cats who trust each other?</p>
            <p>But Rye'wynn beats you to it.</p>
            <p><b>"I know it seems… strange, to be separated from those you love, but–"</b> They swallow and take a slow
                breath, as if to center themselves. <b>"It'll all make sense soon, I promise."</b></p>
            <p>That's all they offer before they move on. Each of the other Keepers begins to move through the gathered
                teams while they speak, ensuring that every cat knows exactly where they need to be. <b>"Before we can
                    carry on with… restoring the world, we must first solidify your place as new Keepers."</b> Rye'wynn
                announces from the front. <b>"Doing so will unlock the power you need to… to be successful in your
                    journeys. In <i>our</i> journey."</b> They emphasize the word with clear conviction.</p>
            <p>Though their gaze seems troubled.</p>
            <p><b>"We plan to enter the… Demon Realm in a land controlled by a demon with few quarrels with
                    Keepers."</b> The
                minimizing of danger in such a case is left unspoken, but easily assumed. <b>"Demons are among the
                    single
                    greatest threat to Keepers and… and to our world as a whole."</b></p>
            <p><b>"Though they're not all bad."</b> Rye'wynn casts a glance to Magus, who watches from a nearby window.
                <b>"So,
                    please, keep your wits about you."</b> They caution.
            </p>
            <p>Rootsnarl's gaze tightens, but he says nothing.</p>
            <p>Rye'wynn continues, <b>"What we seek is a sacred location within the Demon Realm. A place known as The
                    Sunshower Grove."</b> A warm breeze billows past your shoulders, as the sun begins to make itself
                known
                slowly but surely. <b>"Once we enter the Demon Realm each team will need to… find their own way to it,
                    but…
                    you will all have the support of a Keeper should anything go wrong that you can't handle."</b></p>
            <p>The weight of what's coming slowly sinks in, even before Rye'wynn slips through the gate and the other
                Keepers follow, beckoning for each team to do the same.</p>
            <p><b>"We'll guide you to your team's portal into the Demon Realm, but from there–"</b></p>
            <p>Rye'wynn offers a small smile. <b>"You must rely only on each other."</b></p>
            <p>There's a pause and then– <b>"If your loved ones would prefer to stay here, at the house, they will be
                    permitted to in your absence."</b> They seem reluctant to say more.</p>
            <p>And hold their tongue instead of speak.</p>
            <p>In the silence left by their lack of words, the wasteland calls to you in a singsong lull as you step out
                into the forest. The scent of blood and
                ash, death and decay clog your nose. Everything feels overwhelming, but somehow exciting as well.
                There's a great unknown spread out in front of you, and a chance for real change that few cats were ever
                given.</p>
            <p>The path to the portals and what lays beyond will be a long one, and your instincts tighten with a sense
                of impending danger. Yet, when you look to the cats at your side, your new teammates, you're filled with
                the stirrings of something wonderful and strange.</p>
            <p>With them, you may just be able to save the world after all.</p>
            <p>If you survive.</p>

                    This Chapter <b>has</b> a posting requirement! You must post at least
                    <b>5</b> times during the course of the Chapter, or else your character will be killed and you'll be
                    removed from the campaign. That said, there is no length requirement for posts!
                    <br><br>
                    If you're unable to make the 5 posts required due to life reasons, please reach out to a Staff

                    Every Team will have two Channels to themselves in the main server. There will be an OOC Channel
                    for casual conversation and planning, and a Pings Channel for pinned Google Doc links and for
                    Players to ping their team when they've posted (which may or may not include a post summary,
                    it's completely up to you!). The only people with access to these Channels will be the team
                    themselves, as well as the GM (Fox) and the Admins (Okibi & Narl). Make sure to heed the rules
                    pinned in the OOC Channel!

                    Updates will come in the form of Checkpoints on each team's individual doc! If you make an
                    action, wait until a Checkpoint has been given before posting again. If you don't take an action,
                    feel free to post as much
                    as you want in
                    between Checkpoints.

                    your team's OOC Channel to get you a new one. A new Google Doc will automatically be given for
                    any Google Doc exceeding 30 pages.

            Once you've read this page sit tight and wait for your team roles to be assigned on the Discord. When your
            team role has been assigned, you'll have access to the two team-specific Channels as mentioned above. Read
            through the rules posted in the OOC Channel, and then hop on over to the Pings Channel for a link to your
            team's Google Doc. Once you have that link you're all set and can post as soon as you want!
