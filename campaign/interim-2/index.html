        <div style="padding:20px;" class="premise-col">
            <p>It's over.</p>
            <p>You were ripped from the Demon Realm before you were meant to, with the sounds of baying dogs echoing in
                your ears. The taste of ash coats your tongue, and as you gather your senses you realize that you're
                back where you began. In the very place you first found and touched your Star Shard.</p>
            <p>For some it rings hollow, and reeks of failure.</p>
            <p>For others, it's a relief. Those hardships can now be put behind them, and they can return to their
                lives, unburdened by the weight of the world.</p>
            <p>Yet, even without the majority of your powers, your soul still sings. Purple Souls still retain the
                ability to cool themselves at will, and Red Souls to heat themselves at will. Yellow Souls still find a
                glow to their features when they will it, and Green Souls still feel an inborn advantage of the wind
                when attempting to pick up scent trails. This while Blue Souls still easily chase the scent of flowing
                water, and Black Souls wander the night with clearer eyes than most.</p>
            <p>Though it wasn't until a lightning storm raged that those feelings came ever more clearly. Each cat was
                struck without an ounce of pain. Instead, you felt invigorated, and within you two senses suddenly
                awakened– The ability to innately find others of your Soul Class, and a yearning for a City far to the
                North, where none of you have ever been before.</p>
            <p>The North City.</p>
            <p>Your journey there (or lack thereof) was filled with other strange and dangerous events. Golden eyes
                watched you for days before disappearing, and a fox taunted you for a game of tag in return for a
                single, answered question should you have won.</p>
            <p>Then the world began to come apart at the seams.</p>
            <p>Spirits grow agitated and more numerous by the day, unable to be soothed. </p>
            <p>The days themselves run intolerably hot, while the nights chill you down to your bones. The electricity
                in domed cities goes haywire, spitting excessive sparks and popping light bulbs in places. Any remaining
                greenery begins to wilt and wither before your very eyes, and the sea rages with great and growing
                intensity, beaching marine life with every crash.</p>
            <p>And death lingers, and lingers, and lingers…</p>
            <p>All of this appeared around the time that cats first began arriving in the North City. They bore witness
                to the odd, cohesive community of cats and wolves who lived there. </p>
            <p>All of you were welcomed in, and welcomed to the meager spoils found within this crumbled, old dome city.
                That yearning sensation that once filled your chest seemed to have abated at the time. Your soul held
                it's breath and waited for something that was as of yet unexplained.</p>
            <p>Then the night came where it made sense.</p>
            <p>A pale cat by the name of Bright beckoned you to the City Center, and you obliged. It was only there that
                you were able to speak with her, and to observe a conjunction of the moon and the North Star, in a great
                burst of color and light, and shadows dancing across the sky. </p>
            <p>It's there that you met the fox again, and learned of their true nature and form– a nine-tailed fox demon
                and the patron of all Keepers, Kyukusabi. They revealed themself to be the creator of the Soul Wheels,
                Shades, and Partners, and they are the one you're meant to rely on to complete your personal quest. They
                are also the one who gave you a vision of what can only be described as Paradise, with images of all
                your loved ones there to enjoy it as well.</p>
            <p>With it, Kyukusabi gave you the goal of achieving it, should you choose.</p>
            <p>And in the end it is your choice– </p>
            <p>Regain your powers and energy to help save the world, or forego it all and return to what's left of the
                life you lived before. For as long as you can, at least.</p>
            <p>At the end of this vision and this choice, Bright yielded the North City to you, or, as she called it,
                The City of the North Star. It's now your's and your fellows', to turn into the community that you
                choose, both in appearance and functionality. Bright herself has moved on with the rest of the cats and
                wolves who once roamed the city, while Kyukusabi remains, ever elusive and ever watchful.</p>
            <p>A way forward is to be decided sooner rather than later, but first you must find the stragglers who
                didn't attend to the call. This will take some time, but in the meanwhile, perhaps it's best if you
                train your powers for what's to come.</p>
            <p>And start again.</p>

                <p>2 months IC have already gone by for this Interim, and by the time Chapter 3 begins on July 1st, it
                    will be 3 IC Months total since the end of Chapter 2.</p>
                <p>Feel free to utilize any of the roleplay channels in the <b
                        style="background:var(--oblivion)">Interim 02: Game Over?</b> category to
                    roleplay in, and yes, more than one roleplay can be happening in a channel at the same time! If
                    that's a bit too crowded for you, or you just prefer Google Docs in general, feel free to make a
                    Google Doc for you and your roleplay partner(s). You can even post it to the Public Doc Links
                    channel in that same category for folks to look at and/or join, if you want to! It's not a
                    requirement, though.</p>
                <p>Most creatures from cats and humans to dogs and mice and everywhere in between, <b>cannot</b> see
                    when a cat is using their soul magic. They can see the result of it,
                    but without all the bells and whistles. </p>

                    <p>
                    <h5 style="margin-bottom:0;">FOR EXAMPLE</h5><br>
                    A cat has green, stylized fire and uses it in a domed city in front of other creatures.
                    These other creatures would only see this as regular fire, and wouldn't perceive the act of the cat
                    using the fire. Think of it like the spirit sense that some characters have and others don't– though
                    that's not exactly what it is! There <b>are</b> exceptions, of course, but for this Interim, I won't
                    be elaborating further or granting exceptions. All powers should be used with this in mind!</p>
                </div>
                <p>The Soul Wheel has been finalized! All characters lost from this point onwards will still be present
                    on the wheel, but will be deceased, leading to some characters taking on Soul Stones at the end of
                    the campaign.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The next Level Up prompt has been dropped over on the <a
                    href="../../soul-powers/leveling-up/index.html">Level
                    Ups</a> page, so check it out if you want to get your character up to Level 3!</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that the next Chapter will introduce Power Expressions as a mechanic, and every character at
                Level 3 when the Chapter begins will be able to partake in that aspect of the Chapter. If your character
                is not Level 3 by the time that Chapter 3 starts, then they'll have to wait until the following Interim
                (when they're next able to Level Up) to potentially unlock their Power Expression.</p>
