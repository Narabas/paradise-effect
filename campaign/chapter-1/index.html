            Several seconds pass with your eyes closed, and you begin to wonder when Lumi's powers will reach you. Then
            the sounds of strange and eerie birdsong resonates in your ears, and the scent of deep woods permeates your
            nose. At last you open your eyes to find--
            <p>You're nowhere you've ever been before.</p>
            <p>Thick, gnarled trees with deadened trunks and no leaves loom over you. A chilling mist swirls around your
                feet, sending a ripple of unease up your spine. Remnants of old red and orange foliage crunches below
                you with every tentative step you take, and all around you stand all the cats that you had been with at
                the Hideaway-- except for Lumi. She appears soon after, drawing in quickened breaths through her nose as
                if she were attempting to swallow down all indications that she wanted to start panting.</p>
            <p><b>"This way!"</b> Callisto calls, and you turn. When your eyes are on him, you realize something that
                stands not so far behind him.</p>
            <p>A human house, as worn and weary as the warehouse back at the Hideaway, sits in the middle of these
                endless woods. All around it there's a thick, concrete wall that acts as a fence, and at it's helm--
                just a stone's throw from where Callisto is standing-- is a huge, iron gate. The slats seem just big
                enough to slip through.</p>
            <p>Though you're not sure you want to.</p>
            <p><b>"Took you long enough."</b> A voice chimes from beyond those iron gates.</p>
            <p>As you allow yourself to be coaxed through the gate, you half expect to see Kohaku standing there, though
                the voice isn't his. Lounging at the doorstep to the house is someone else that a few cats would find
                familiar-- Orpheus. He flicks his tail to and fro, and beside him is another cat bathed in all white
                fur. </p>
            <p><b>"Orpheus!"</b> Lumi snaps, though she doesn't seem angry so much as... irritated. <b>"Where in the
                    hell have you been?"</b> He shakes his head, but doesn't answer, and instead rises to meet each of
                you now approaching the front door. The front yard is overgrown, and littered with human garbage and old
                cat toys. Rootsnarl's eyes are settled firmly upon the white cat, whose eyes are peculiarly split at her
                pupils, with one side being golden-yellow and the other being bright blue. </p>
            <p><b>"Getting me, of course!"</b> She chirps with a wave of her tail. Her gaze scours you and all of the
                other non-Keepers. <b>"Oh. My. Goodness. Look at them!"</b> The stranger seems enthusiastic. Kohaku
                lands somewhere above her and Orpheus, peering down with a discerning yellow gaze.</p>
            <p><b>"Chasm?"</b> Rye'wynn queries with confusion.</p>
            <p>She answers with a nod. <b>"Orpheus told me all about what's happening, and I'm here to help."</b> Chasm
                speaks with great flourish, her whiskers quivering in delight. <b>"It's been so long since we've seen
                    such potential, no? After what happened last time..."</b> Her gaze trails to Kohaku above, whose
                eyes narrow.</p>
            <p>Rootsnarl pushes past the group. <b>"That's enough. We're not here to chat."</b> He rumbles, and Chasm
                laughs. <b>"The more things change, the more they stay the same, huh, big guy?"</b> He doesn't offer her
                another look, but Chasm seems hardly phased. <b>"Yes, yes, go on and do your thing, cuties!"</b> She
                adds after a moment, tail shaking in a sociable manner. <b>"We've scouted the area and for the moment,
                    she doesn't seem to have her eye on this place. Not sure why that is, though."</b></p>
            <p><b>"Thank you."</b> Lumi answers sincerely, and Rye'wynn and Callisto nod their agreement. Chasm gestures
                it off with a dismissive paw. <b>"It's the least I can do!"</b></p>
            <p>Rye'wynn motions towards you and every cat around you. </p>
            <p><b>"The entrance is over here."</b></p>

                    Unlike the Prologue, this Chapter <b>does</b> have a posting requirement! You must post at least
                    <b>5</b> times during the course of the Chapter, or else your character will be killed and you'll be
                    removed from the campaign. That said, there is no length requirement for posts!
                    <br><br>
                    If you're unable to make the 5 posts required due to life reasons, please reach out to a Staff

                    Every Team will have two Channels to themselves in the main server. There will be an OOC Channel
                    for casual conversation and planning, and a Pings Channel for pinned Google Doc links and for
                    Players to ping their team when they've posted (which may or may not include a post summary,
                    it's completely up to you!). The only people with access to these Channels will be the team
                    themselves, as well as the GM (Fox) and the Admins (Okibi & Narl). Make sure to heed the rules
                    pinned in the OOC Channel!

                    Updates will come in the form of Checkpoints on each team's individual doc! If you make an
                    action, wait until a Checkpoint has been given before posting again. Examples of actions are in
                    the Chapter Announcement in the server. If you don't take an action, feel free to post as much
                    as you want in
                    between Checkpoints.

                    your team's OOC Channel to get you a new one. A new Google Doc will automatically be given for
                    any Google Doc exceeding 50 pages.

            Once you've read this page sit tight and wait for your team roles to be assigned on the Discord. When your
            team role has been assigned, you'll have access to the two team-specific Channels as mentioned above. Read
            through the rules posted in the OOC Channel, and then hop on over to the Pings Channel for a link to your
            team's Google Doc. Once you have that link you're all set and can post as soon as you want!
