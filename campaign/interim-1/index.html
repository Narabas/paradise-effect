            <p>Can it really be real? Are you being allowed to go <i>home?</i></p>
            <p>It is, and you are.</p>
            <p>In the wake of Lumi's horrific death, the Keepers have stepped away from all attempts to keep you some
                place that you don't want to be. They invite you to leave this place altogether, and implore you to stay
                safe and to keep those you're close to safe as well. Their words are genuine, and carry with it a new
                and uncomfortable weight that you've never felt before.</p>
            <p>Everything about today has been painfully sobering.</p>
            <p>Yet, in the same breath as they would see you leave, they also welcome you to stay, if that's your
                choice. The Keepers' House, the very one you entered upon arrival, still stands.</p>
            <p>They promise you food, water, clean air, and medicine– and a soft place to sleep as well. They speak of
                an innate, in-born sense for all who have awakened. This sense can pinpoint the location of this House
                no matter where you are, so you'll always know your way back should you need it.</p>
            <p>Or want it.</p>
            <p>This is where they'll be, too. </p>
            <p>Rootsnarl, Callisto, Kohaku, Chasm, Iseult, and Rye'wynn will remain at the Keeper House for now. They
                seemingly intend to plan their next steps, and to offer all of that support they mentioned before and
                more, if possible. This is also where they intend to bury Lumi, and the others lost as well, if other
                cats have not yet claimed their bodies for burial.</p>
            <p>So, the choice is your's–- <b>Where will you go?</b></p>

                <p>This Interim will last roughly <b>2 months</b> IC (In Character) and OOC (Out Of Character)! This
                    means that the date of Chapter 2's start will roughly be around Halloween, and by then the
                    characters will have lived through 2 more months of their lives.</p>
                <p>Feel free to utilize any of the roleplay channels in the <b style="background:var(--oblivion)">Interim 01: The World</b> category to
                    roleplay in, and yes, more than one roleplay can be happening in a channel at the same time! If
                    that's a bit too crowded for you, or you just prefer Google Docs in general, feel free to make a
                    Google Doc for you and your roleplay partner(s). You can even post it to the Public Doc Links
                    channel in that same category for folks to look at and/or join, if you want to! It's not a
                    requirement, though.</p>
                <p>Characters <b>can</b> come and go to the Keeper House. As in, they're free to come by at any time,
                    and leave at any time– and can do so however many times they want to!</p>
                <p>There will be Keeper Interactions for those who choose to stay at (or who return to) the Keeper
                    House, but those will be at <i>least</i> a couple of OOC weeks away while I recoup with a small
                    break. There will also likely be other goodies during this Interim, both for those who stay (or
                    return), and those who don't.</p>
                <p>For those who leave, please note– Most creatures from cats and humans to dogs and mice and everywhere
                    in between, <b>cannot</b> see when a cat is using their soul magic. They can see the result of it,
                    but without all the bells and whistles. </p>
                <div style="background:var(--oblivion);padding:30px;"><p><h5 style="margin-bottom:0;">FOR EXAMPLE</h5><br>
                    A cat has green, stylized fire and uses it in a domed city in front of other creatures.
                    These other creatures would only see this as regular fire, and wouldn't perceive the act of the cat
                    using the fire. Think of it like the spirit sense that some characters have and others don't– though
                    that's not exactly what it is! There <b>are</b> exceptions, of course, but for this Interim, I won't
                    be elaborating further or granting exceptions. All powers should be used with this in mind!</p></div>
            </div>
            <p>Level Up prompts have been dropped over on the <a href="../../soul-powers/leveling-up/index.html">Level Ups</a> page for both <b>Lvl 0 to Lvl 1</b> and <b>Lvl 1 to Lvl 2</b>, so everyone should have at least one level up that they can do this Interim if they choose!</p>
