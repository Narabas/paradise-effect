            It's still dark when a familiar red-furred nose prods you awake, or when a white-furred mouth grins at
            those who hadn't slept the night before. Kyukusabi's golden eyes are bright and shining, reflecting what
            little light is to be found in the North City at this hour.
            <p><b>"It's time."</b> They speak, clacking their teeth together with a certain finality.</p>
            <p>After Rootsnarl and Chasm had been carried, injured and bleeding, into your city with the help of a few
                of your own, and the familiar cat demon from the Keepers' House, Magus, news was passed around like a
                good piece of prey. The other Keepers were in trouble after seeking out the Worldender– a cat whose true
                name is revealed to be Leandra– on her own turf– a domed city to the south named New Argos– and losing a
                fight they thought they could win. </p>
            <p>For better or worse, each of you knew you'd have to travel there as well. </p>
            <p>For some it's to rescue the Keepers, your only lifeline in these chaotic times. For others, it's the
                chance to face the Worldender and to put an end to all this bloodshed and death.</p>
            <p>And for the rest, it's a bit of both.</p>
            <p>You could kill two birds with one stone, after all.</p>
            <p>So the plan was drawn up and passed around in ways that you all decided. Kyukusabi leapt in when the
                decisions had already been made, stating that they would lead you towards New Argos, while Magus stayed
                behind in the North City to ensure Rootsnarl and Chasm continued to heal.</p>
            <p>That's why, just before the morning light passed over the land, they prodded you awake or grinned at you
                with their eyes glimmering just so. Their words pass over you, and settle on your shoulders.</p>
            <p>It really was time.</p>
            <p>All 113 of you, in small groups and pockets of your choosing, exit the city without fanfare. The wastes
                are as harsh and unforgiving now as they'd ever been. When the sun begins to rise, the light is dull,
                hidden behind thick cloud cover. But there's a smog, too, that curls around your throat and makes you
                want to cough. The scent of old death hits you suddenly, just before the edge of a forest.</p>
            <p>It's late morning now, when old, deadened tree limbs are pushing through your fur. Kyukusabi trots at the
                head of the procession, waving their tail, and darting and weaving between cats as if to ensure that
                everyone knows where to go, and can see them leading them.</p>
            <p><b>"Not much farther now!"</b> It gekkers, and you wonder briefly why they'd laugh at a time like this.
                Though, it's easy to dismiss as just another strange trait of your patron demon.</p>
            <p>The smog grows thicker and thicker still, until you can barely see a paw in front of your face.</p>
            <p>Then it feels lighter, less heavy on your lungs. Pale, blue-silver mist threads through the smog, cutting
                it clean through and swirling up and around your nose. At least, you think it does, because you can't
                even see down the length of your own muzzle. You call out to those you were walking with– to friends,
                family, and acquaintances alike.</p>
            <p>But there is no answer.</p>
            <p>The trees tighten around you, squeezing you just enough to make walking uncomfortable. Sharp branches jut
                against you, but not enough to slice your flesh. All of the smog has now dissipated in favor of the
                strange mist, and you squint, wondering if this was another of Kyukusabi's tricks.</p>
            <p>The fox doesn't seem to be anywhere around, though. There's no gekkering, no boasting, and certainly no
                flash of red fur sprinting through the fog.</p>
            <p>There's only a chill running down your spine.</p>
            <p>And the scent of rain.</p>
            <!--- The storm is coming. --->

                    <b>5</b> times during the course of the Chapter, or else your character will be killed and you'll be
                    removed from the campaign. That said, there is no length requirement for posts!
                    <br><br>
                    If you're unable to make the 5 posts required due to life reasons, please reach out to a Staff

                    <br><br>
                    Additionally if you make <b>10+</b> posts over the course of the entire Chapter, you'll be able to

                    Every Team will have two Channels to themselves in the main server. There will be an OOC Channel
                    for casual conversation and planning, and a Pings Channel for pinned Google Doc links and for
                    Players to ping their team when they've posted.
                    <br><br>
                    The only people with access to these Channels will be the team
                    themselves, as well as the GM (Fox) and the Admins (Okibi & Narl). and any Mods assisting with that
                    team's Checkpoints (Robyn & Sleepy). Make sure to heed the rules pinned in the OOC Channel!

                    allowed 2 actions per Checkpoint. Use them wisely! Staff Members will interpret your actions behind
                    the scenes, and include the outcome in the following Checkpoint. Don't assume an action has an
                    automatic effect unless specified by a Staff Member!

                    your team's OOC Channel to get you a new one. A new Google Doc will automatically be given for
                    any Google Doc exceeding 30 pages.
