        <h1>Campaign Structure</h1>
        <b>The Paradise Effect</b> is a modified, set-end D&D campaign using the magical Soul Class/Partner mechanic as
        seen in the roleplays <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/the-paradise-trials" target="_blank"><u>The Paradise
            Trials</u></a> and <a href="https://theparadisetrials.wixsite.com/paradiserising"
          target="_blank"><u>Paradise Rising</u></a>. However, this roleplay is completely independent of the universe,
        and has no additional correlation besides the use of these wonderful mechanics. The world, history, locations,
        NPCs, and so on have been created by the GM specifically and solely for this campaign.
        <p>This campaign is planned to have an official conclusion, rather than continue on indefinitely. Once the plot
          is complete, the campaign is over, and any further development and interactions between characters will be up
          to the players. Be that as it may, the story’s ending is open, and CAN be affected by the players actions.</p>
        <p>The format that this campaign will follow will be in reference to a book, with a max of 120 players at the
          start. The parts are as follows:</p>

    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="content-info wider">
      <p>Each <b>Chapter</b> will take place over the course of one to two months, with a two month break (or
        <b>interim</b>) in between each Chapter. These interims will be there to give both the GM and the players a
        chance to sit back, relax, take a breath, and explore their characters in different environments and situations
        at their leisure, and without the pressure of needing to move on for the sake of Chapter goals.</p>
      <p>The Prologue and the Epilogue will be handled differently, and will most likely last a shorter length of time
        overall, and have a shorter interim between them and the Chapter directly before or after.</p>

      <p>As for the Soul Class mechanic, this will be an integral part of this campaign. Every character will have a
        Soul Class, a Soul Shade, and a Soul Partner (or Partners!), to be discovered over the course of the campaign
        through cryptic hints and in-character experiences. These will be chosen based on multiple factors, many of
        which depend on your character!</p>
      <p>While each of these aspects will ultimately be decided by the GM, what you do with them is entirely your own
        choice within the scope of your character's own abilities and limitations. Feel free to find fun, new avenues
        for your character and their self-expression.</p>
      <p>Above all, this campaign is meant to be fun for everyone involved.</p>
