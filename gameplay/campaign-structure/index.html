        <h1>Campaign Structure</h1>
        <b>The Paradise Effect</b> is a modified, set-end D&D campaign using the magical Soul Class/Partner mechanic as
        seen in the roleplays <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/the-paradise-trials" target="_blank"><u>The Paradise
            Trials</u></a> and <a href="https://theparadisetrials.wixsite.com/paradiserising"
          target="_blank"><u>Paradise Rising</u></a>. However, this roleplay is completely independent of the universe,
        and has no additional correlation besides the use of these wonderful mechanics. The world, history, locations,
        NPCs, and so on have been created by the GM specifically and solely for this campaign.
        <p>This campaign is planned to have an official conclusion, rather than continue on indefinitely. Once the plot
          is complete, the campaign is over, and any further development and interactions between characters will be up
          to the players. Be that as it may, the storyâ€™s ending is open, and CAN be affected by the players actions.</p>
        <p>The format that this campaign will follow will be in reference to a book, with a max of 120 players at the
          start. The parts are as follows:</p>

          EPILOGUE

    <br>
    <div class="content-info wider">
      <p>Each <b>Chapter</b> will take place over the course of one to two months, with a 2 - 3 month break (or
        <b>Interim</b>) in
        between each Chapter.
      </p>
      <p>During <b>Chapters</b> players will be expected to post at least semi-frequently in their team's designated
        posting
        location (be it gdocs, discord, etc.) and respond to story beats, events, and challenges that may be thrown
        their character's way to further the story as well as character growth and development. Chapters have a 5 post
        minimum for all players! If a player fails to meet the post minimum (unless a hiatus has previously been
        discussed!) they will be removed from the campaign and their character will be killed in a plot-relevant way.
        Unfortunately, due to the nature of the way Paradise campaigns are set up, a character can only leave the game
        by being killed.</p>
      <p>Conversely, <b>Interims</b> will be there to give both the GM and the players a chance to sit back, relax, take
        a
        breath, and explore their characters in different environments, interactions, and situations at their leisure,
        and without the pressure of needing to move on for the sake of Chapter goals. Posting is <b>not</b> required for
        Interims!</p>
      <p>The Prologue and the Epilogue will be handled differently, and will most likely last a shorter length of time
        overall, and have a shorter interim between them and the Chapter directly before or after. </p>
      <br>
      <hr><br>
      <p>As for the Soul Class mechanic, this will be an integral part of this campaign. Every character will have a
        Soul Class, a Soul Shade, and a Soul Partner (or Partners!), to be discovered over the course of the campaign
        through cryptic hints and in-character experiences. These will be chosen based on multiple factors, many of
        which depend on your character!</p>
      <p>While each of these aspects will ultimately be decided by the GM, what you do with them is entirely your own
        choice within the scope of your character's own abilities and limitations. Feel free to find fun, new avenues
        for your character and their self-expression.</p>
      <p>Above all, this campaign is meant to be fun for everyone involved.</p>

      <h5>SCHEDULE</h5>
      <p>Now that we have an official Prologue start date, I can tentatively piece together what the rest of the year
        will look like for the campaign. Bear in mind that this can (and will likely) change in some capacity depending
        on Staff availability and how long Chapters might end up taking, but for the moment this is roughly what our
        schedule looks like:</p>
      <p><b>Prologue</b> <br>[06/10/2022 - 07/01/2022]</p>
      <p><b>Interim 00</b> <br>[07/01/2022 - 07/15/2022]</p>
      <p><b>Chapter 01</b> <br>[07/15/2022 - 08/29/2022]</p>
      <p><b>Interim 01</b> <br>[08/29/2022 - 10/29/2022]</p>
      <p><b>Chapter 02</b> <br>[10/29/2022 - 12/10/2022]</p>
      <p><b>Interim 02</b> <br>[12/10/2022 - 03/10/2022]</p>
