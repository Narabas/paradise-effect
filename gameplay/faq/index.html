    <div class="rules faq">
      <div class="rule-list">
        <div class="rule"><b>How many players will there be?</b><br><br>
          120 is what I'm shooting for!</div>
        <div class="rule"><b>What do star fragments look like?</b><br><br>
          They're small, single color stones that can fit in the palm of a cat's hand. They can be all shapes and sizes,
          even defined ones.
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Can two (or more) cats find the same star fragment?</b><br><br>
          Yes and no. A single star fragment <u>will</u> be visible to all who look at it, but it's only the cat who
          first touches it who will feel that strange sense of relief. That said, two (or more) fragments can fall close
          together for a similar effect.</div>
        <div class="rule"><b>What kind of abilities do spirits possess?</b><br><br>
          Think of them akin to ghosts/poltergeists. While some may simply appear from time to time and do nothing else,
          others may mimic speech or laughter, move objects around, heat/cool areas, or go as far as striking out at
          cats or pushing them around. These aren't the only expressions either, so feel free to ask if you have
          something specific in mind!
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Can my character have met a Keeper?</b><br><br>
          No! They're known only in tales passed down a few generations, and are akin to mythological figures.
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Can cats communicate with other animals?</b><br><br>
          Not usually, no. Species of animals generally have a different "language" that is distinct from one another.
          With years of exposure and a dedicated undertaking of trying to learn another language, communication
          <u>is</u> possible, but not largely looked well upon or tolerated, except in very rare cases. That said,
          instances of few-word interactions and body language gauging to reach a very simple understanding between two
          different species is more possible.</div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Could a blind character sense the cosmic event in the premise?</b><br><br>
          Absolutely!
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Can my cat sense or see Spirits?</b><br><br>
          Yes! Whether or not your character is attuned enough to witness spirits is entirely your choice.
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Do star fragments make impact craters?</b><br><br>
          No! Star fragments hit the ground very lightly, as though simply tossed from close proximity rather than
          plummeting to earth from the sky. If one were to fall and hit a cat or other creature, it could either bounce
          off lightly, or leave a small cut. They don't strike with enough force to seriously wound or kill!
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>How much mobility do cats have with their front paws? Can they craft?</b><br><br>
          The amount of mobility each character has is entirely dependent on their player's preferences! I plan on being
          fairly lenient with the usage of a cat's dewclaws/side toes as thumb-adjacent appendages, so characters can
          have paws more like traditional cats, or with more flexibility to be able to craft and grasp with more
          precision. Whichever you prefer!
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Can a spirit purposefully help, hurt, save, or kill a cat?</b><br><br>
          No! Spirits lack true agency, meaning they exist solely as the embodiment of an emotion or abstract concept.
          The actions they take can certainly do all of that, but they cannot make the conscious choice to do so. It
          would merely be a byproduct of whatever feeling or concept they're chasing.
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>What are dome cities like?</b><br><br>
          Dome cities are diverse cities in that they can vary wildly from one to the next. Some may be advanced
          cyberpunk-adjacent cities, while others may be crumbling and falling apart, and anything in between! What they
          all have in common is that large concentrations of humans and other animals reside within them, who are
          protected by a signature dome structure overhead that acts as a barrier between them and the outside elements
          of the wastes. The dome can be clear or opaque, and may be largely in tact or falling apart.

          <br><br>Within the domes can be treated just like regular cities. Streets, buildings, stores, parks-- All
          kinds of human things can be found within! The air quality is generally better (though not perfect) than the
          wasteland, though there are always holes for cats and other animals to exploit to get in and out of the city
          easily and without detection. While personalized cars and other family-owned vehicles do populate in these
          cities, trains, buses, and boats are more common. Additionally, trains are the most common form of transport
          between domes, and are considered the most safe. They're also what delivers goods between domed cities, with
          boats sometimes doing the same.
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Can humans live outside of domed cities?</b><br><br>
          Yes! It's considered highly unsafe and far from ergonomical due to the need to get food, healthcare, and other
          supplies from the domed cities, but humans definitely can live outside of domed cities if they prefer.
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Can my character's history be vague, not true, or unknown on their
            application/bio?</b><br><br>
          Yes! On the application form there's a space to link a public written application, and a space to link a
          private one. The private one will only be known to the GM!
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>What sort of world location does the campaign exist in?</b><br><br>
          In order to account for a wide variety of backstories and locations, the campaign exists in a nebulous,
          non-descript fantasyland. For generalized purposes you can refer to it as Earth, and reference known
          countries/locations if they are of importance to your character's background!
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Are there plants within the domed cities?</b><br><br>
          Yes! Those that exist commonly around the city are those that grow well with little to no sunlight. For those
          which require more sunlight, however, they can be grown in specialized, UV "greenhouses", or with UV lights
          within the comfort of individual homes.
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Can I use traditional art for the application as opposed to digital art?</b><br><br>
          Absolutely!
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>How will cats meet up for the start of the campaign?</b><br><br>
          That's something to be discovered within the Prologue!
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>How much time transpires between the cosmic event in the premise, and the start of the
            campaign?</b><br><br>
          From the moment that your character sees the comet streaking through the sky and fragmenting off, to the start
          of the campaign, is around 1 day! Your character sees the comet happen one night, finds their fragment the
          next day, and then they hear that voice in their dreams the night after they found the fragment.
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Can we choose what color the star fragment that our character finds is?</b><br><br>
          Yes! As long as it's a single color, anything goes.
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Will there be a map for the campaign?</b><br><br>
          As of right now, no, though there may be one made later if it becomes necessary to the campaign.
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Do our characters get to keep their star fragment? Can we turn them into an
            accessory?</b><br><br>
          Yes, and yes! The star fragments can have a convenient hole in them to feed through a chain, rope, etc. to
          turn it into a necklace or other accessory, though it's not required. It's also not required to keep the star
          fragment if your character would have chosen to leave it behind!
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Will our characters age during the campaign?</b><br><br>
          Yes!
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>What months are which seasons? Which season are we starting in?</b><br><br>
          April - September is considered Summer, whereas October - March is considered Winter. We'll be starting at the
          beginning of Summer!
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Will stats ever go above 10? Will we earn more stat points over the course of the
            campaign?</b><br><br>
          No, and yes! Stats will stay maxed at 10, but you will have opportunities to gain more stat points during the
          campaign.
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>Can you chip or break a star fragment?</b><br><br>
          No! They are unbreakable.
        </div>
        <div class="rule"><b>How much human speak can a cat know? Can they read human writing?</b><br><br>
          Through dedicated learning, a cat can learn up to roughly 20 individual spoken human words, and 10 or less
          written words!
