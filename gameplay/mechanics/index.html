      <h1>Mechanics</h1>
The Paradise Effect, as a set end campaign, will function in a similar way to traditional D&D campaigns. Your characters will have stats, mods, strengths and weaknesses, and rolls will be used to determine most outcomes except in a few choice instances as decided by the GM.
<br><br><hr><br>
      <div class="content-info mechanics">
      <h5>STATS</h5>
      <p>Your stats will help you get into (and out of) all kinds of situations and trouble, the dicebot-willing. They may also help or hinder the starting power you have with certain Soul Classes, depending on your stats and Class.</p>
<p>While these stats don't necessarily have to reflect your character's actual abilities, for more authentic, character-focused gameplay, it's recommended you try to fill it out truthfully as best you can. This means pouring more stat points into your character's natural strengths, and withholding points from their weak spots.</p>
<p>Every character has six stat brackets, which are as follows:</p>
      
      <div style="column-count:2;">
        <p><b>STRENGTH</b><br>
          This is your character's raw physical power. It will be used in instances where they need their muscles to work for them, such as in fighting, climbing, or swimming.</p>
        <p><b>DEXTERITY</b><br>
          This is how agile or graceful your character is. It will be used in instances where they make clever use of their footwork, such as in finesse fighting, dodging, acrobatics, stealth, or running.</p>
        <p><b>CONSTITUTION</b><br>
          This is your character's health and endurance. It will be used in all instances pertaining to their HP, but also in calculating how well they heal from sickness or injury, or how many strenuous conditions they can handle, and for how long.</p>
        <p><b>INTELLIGENCE</b><br>
          This is your character's intellect. It will be used in instances when they need knowledge  or memory to figure something out, such as strategizing, identifying, or investigating.</p>
        <p><b>WISDOM</b><br>
          This is your character's insight. It will be used in instances of reading body language, understanding feelings, or perceiving the environment, or when caring for wounds.</p>
        <p><b>CHARISMA</b><br>
          This is your character's voice. It will be used in instances of putting on performances, lying, threatening, or charming your fellows. At best it can spare you some skepticism or help curb violence. At worst, it can get you killed or banished. Use wisely!</p>
      </div>
      
<br>
<h5>MODIFIERS (MODS)</h5>
      <p><b>Modifiers</b> are what's added on to (or subtracted from) your character's rolls to accurately reflect their stats. The actual mods for the campaign will only be known by the GM, but because they're derived from your stats, make sure your stats are what you want, and what you feel best represents your character, so they can accurately reflect what your character is capable of.</p>
<p>It may make a difference and it may not, but oftentimes a single point or two can be the deciding factor between success and failure.</p>
      <br>
<h5>STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES</h5>
<p>Every character will have 3 strengths and 3 weaknesses for this campaign. Strengths will give a bonus to rolls, while weaknesses will give a penalty to rolls. These can be personality traits, physical capabilities, anything! If they're too vague or the GM cannot figure out a way to implement them into actual gameplay, you may be asked to change them at the start of the campaign, before your application is accepted.</p>
<br>
        <h5>HEALTH POINTS (HP)</h5>
<p>As of right now there are no HP mechanics at play behind the scenes, and players are free to determine how much damage their character takes and how it affects them in-game. However, HP mechanics may be introduced later if the GM decides that it would be beneficial to the campaign at that point!</p>
<br>
        <h5>ROLLING</h5>
<p>All rolling will be done behind the scenes! Therefore, you won't have to worry about this mechanic except for if/when you and other members choose to roll in instances where the GM would not. This is usually done for interim roleplays, but can also be used to decide an outcome between two (or more) characters within a Chapter if it's agreed to by all involved members.</p>
<p>Dice Maiden will be our dice bot for the campaign, and the command to roll is !roll d(number) without the parentheses.</p>
        <br>
<h5>CHARACTER DEATH</h5>
<p>There are only four instances of guaranteed death for your character:</p>
<p>  - You miss the minimum posting requirement of 5 posts during one of the campaign's Chapters, and you’re not on a hiatus that has been discussed with the GM prior to the end of the Chapter.</p>
<p>  - You choose to leave the campaign.</p>
<p>  - You choose to kill your character.</p>
<p>  - You break a rule that results in your immediate removal from the campaign.</p>
<p>There are an abundance of ways to save a character from the brink of death, and they will be utilized as needed unless any of the above criteria apply. If you want your character to take reckless actions but then be saved by means other than your fellow characters, let your GM know and they'll figure something out!</p>
