      <h4 style="opacity:0.5;">Please read thoroughly.</h4>

    <div class="rules">
      <div class="rule-list">
        <div class="rule">
          <h2>01</h2>
          Be kind, courteous, and respectful always. Discrimination is not tolerated in the server, and you WILL be
          removed from the campaign for it.
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
          <h2>02</h2>
          You must be 18+ years old to join this campaign! This is mostly just out of the personal preference of me, the
          GM, but also due to the level of violence, blood/gore, death, and character trauma that is expected in this
          campaign. I can assure you that I'm not going to go looking for your age, but please don't abuse the honor
          system either!
          <p>If you're currently 17, but will be 18 before the official start of the campaign (June 3rd), you may apply
            as though you're currently 18.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
          <h2>03</h2>Predatory behavior is not allowed here, and you WILL be removed from the campaign for violating
          this rule. Additionally, if someone is making you feel uncomfortable, even if you're not sure if the other
          party's behavior is predatory, reach out to your GM immediately and they'll make sure you're safe.
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
          <h2>04</h2>
          Always make sure to respect your fellow members' triggers and sensitivities, and if you're asked to spoiler
          tag/put a trigger warning (tw) on something, please do so.
          <p>In general, everyone should spoiler tag/put a trigger warning on mentions of intense violence and gore, any
            and all forms of blatant abuse, character death, mentions of drugs and alcohol, suicide/suicidal ideation,
            and self-harm. Sexual content is not allowed in this campaign, even with a spoiler tag or trigger warning.
          </p>
          <p>Make sure these warnings are displayed prominently and are labeled clearly before the sensitive material
            itself. Repeatedly failing to properly spoiler tag/trigger warn something after being asked to do so is
            grounds for removal from the campaign.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
          <h2>05</h2>
          All posted artwork must belong to you, whether it was created by you or for you. I will not accept traced or
          plagiarized artwork on the server. Colored lineart/bases ARE allowed, and fall under the blanket of artwork
          created by and for you, as long as you credit the creator of those lines/bases.
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
          <h2>06</h2>
          No god-modding. You only control your character, and should not assume that your character's actions can
          impact another member's character, or an NPC's, without the owner's permission.
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
          <h2>07</h2>
          No meta-gaming. Keep out-of-character (OOC) interactions and information to OOC and in-character (IC)
          interactions and information to IC.
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
          <h2>08</h2>
          IC actions have IC consequences. Bear this in mind when taking on risky plots, or taking risky actions!
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
          <h2>09</h2>
          Be mindful of character ages and age gaps when pursuing romantic relationships and crushes, especially for
          characters 18 months (1.5 years) and younger. If it feels at all inappropriate don't pursue it.
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
          <h2>10</h2>
          If the GM has asked you to keep an aspect of the campaign secret (your soul shade, for example), please do so.
          Accidents happen, but if you're caught spoiling something on purpose, that may be grounds for removal from the
          campaign.
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
          <h2>11</h2>
          Please try to roleplay and plot even with people you don't know well. I want members to have as many
          interactions as they're comfortable with, and with an expansive cast of characters. To do this, we need an
          open environment where members can easily integrate into the group and find spaces for their character to be,
          as well as people they can comfortably discuss ideas with.
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
          <h2>12</h2>
          Treat all of your plotlines with sensitivity and respect, especially those pertaining to abuse, mental illness
          and self-harm, lgbtqia+ issues (such as transphobia, homophobia, conversion therapy, etc.), and
          abortion/miscarriage. They should never be glorified, and any plotline that does will not be allowed in this
          campaign.
          <p>If you need help approaching a sensitive subject, please feel free to reach out to your GM and they can try
            to help!</p>
